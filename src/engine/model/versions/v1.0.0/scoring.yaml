# Clean effective punching weights
# "DAMAGE is king" - fighter dealing more damage should win rounds
clean_punching:
  clean_punches_weight: 0.8         # Clean shots (reduced - count less)
  power_punches_weight: 1.5         # Power punches
  jabs_weight: 0.2                  # Jabs worth minimal
  damage_weight: 6.0                # DAMAGE - very heavily weighted
  damage_divisor: 10                # Divide damage dealt by this
  significant_strikes_weight: 3.0   # Big, impactful shots

# Effective aggression scoring
# Moving forward AND landing, not just charging
effective_aggression:
  forward_movement_base: 0.03       # Per second of forward movement
  outlanding_bonus: 2               # Bonus for landing more punches
  damage_advantage_bonus: 18        # BIG bonus for damage advantage
  absolute_damage_divisor: 15       # Divide damage by this for bonus

# Ring generalship scoring
# Who is dictating the fight?
ring_generalship:
  center_control_weight: 0.2        # Controlling center ring
  opponent_ropes_weight: 0.25       # Putting opponent on ropes
  opponent_corner_weight: 0.4       # Trapping opponent in corner

  # Backward movement penalties
  backward_penalty_winning: 0.02    # Minimal penalty when dealing damage
  backward_penalty_losing: 0.08     # Penalty when running without offense

  # Positional penalties
  own_ropes_penalty: 0.12           # Being on ropes yourself
  own_corner_penalty: 0.2           # Being cornered yourself

# Defense scoring
defense:
  blocked_weight: 1.0               # Points per punch blocked
  evaded_weight: 2.0                # Points per punch evaded (more skillful)
  damage_received_divisor: 20       # Penalty divisor for damage taken

# Judge preferences application multipliers
judge_application:
  clean_punching_multiplier: 1.2    # Applied to clean punching score
  power_shots_multiplier: 2.0       # Applied to power punches landed
  volume_multiplier: 0.25           # Applied to punches landed (reduced)
  defense_multiplier: 0.8           # Applied to defense score

# Round determination thresholds
round_thresholds:
  clear_round: 12                   # Score diff for clear round (10-9)
  moderate_advantage: 4             # Score diff for contested round
  close_round_even_chance: 0.30     # Probability of 10-10 in very close rounds

# Knockdown scoring
knockdown:
  min_round_score: 7                # Minimum score possible (3 KDs = 10-7)
  default_weight: 1.0               # Base knockdown weight
  # Note: Each knockdown = -1 point to fighter knocked down
  # 1 KD = 10-8 round, 2 KDs = 10-7 round, 3 KDs = 10-6 (usually stopped)

# Judge consistency affects close round calls
# Lower consistency = more likely to "miss" close rounds
consistency:
  wrong_call_chance: 0.4            # Chance of wrong call when inconsistent
  moderate_check_threshold: 0.6     # Roll threshold for consistency check
